# Networking Equipment and Protocols

## Description:
This markdown file discusses common networking equipment and their functions, as well as their relation to the OSI model. It also explores the capabilities of routers in managing connected devices and the configuration of DHCP servers on a network.

## Key-terms:
1. Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.
2. Switch: A networking device that connects devices on a local area network (LAN) and forwards data packets to their destination based on MAC addresses.
3. Repeater: A networking device that amplifies or regenerates signals to extend the reach of a network.
4. Access Point: A networking device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.
5. OSI Model: The Open Systems Interconnection model, a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.

## Assignment:
1. Identify and describe the functions of common networking equipment.
2. Explore the device list and additional information available on the router regarding connected devices.
3. Determine the location and configuration of the DHCP server on your network.

## Used Sources:
- Network devices: Wikipedia
- OSI model: Cisco Networking Academy

## Encountered Issues:
No significant issues were encountered while completing the assignment.

## Outcome:
The assignment was successfully completed. The functions of common networking equipment were identified and described. Additionally, the router's device list and DHCP server configuration were accessed and analyzed. Screenshots were taken to demonstrate the findings.
