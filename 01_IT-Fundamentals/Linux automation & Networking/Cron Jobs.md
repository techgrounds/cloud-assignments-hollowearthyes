Automating Tasks with Cron Jobs

## Description
This markdown file provides instructions for creating and scheduling Bash scripts using Cron jobs to automate tasks on a Linux machine.

## Key-terms
1. Cron: A time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems.
2. Bash script: A script written in the Bash (Bourne Again Shell) language, commonly used in Unix-like operating systems.
